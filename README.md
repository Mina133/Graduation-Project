<h1>Zooba</h1> 
Zooba is a medical vending machine, but not a traditional one, the patient enters the prescription into 
the machine in the prescription place and the machine reads it and asks the user to check the medicine 
then pay via QR where the user should scan to open the payment page on our site. Also, if the 
the patient has no prescription the user can select one of the (OTC) On the Counter drugs than pay 
via QR.  
Also, we have one more feature if the patient is sick and doesnâ€™t know what he should do, he 
can chat with the chatbot so that he can recommend an OTC drug or recommend going to the doctor if 
there is danger or lack of data that the user presents. 
My role in this project was whole the software, the connection between raspberry and AVR to 
control the motors, also I database creator and manager, OCR that reads the prescription, and 
GUI designer and developer.
