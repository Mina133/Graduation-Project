<h1>Zooba</h1> 
<h2 >Overview</h2>
Zooba is a cutting-edge medical vending machine designed to provide patients with convenient and efficient medication access. Unlike traditional vending machines, Zooba offers a comprehensive solution that includes prescription processing, over-the-counter (OTC) drug dispensing, and a chatbot for healthcare guidance.

<h2>Functionality</h2>
<ls>
<li><strong>Prescription Processing:</strong> Patients can input their prescriptions directly into the machine. Zooba's OCR technology accurately reads the prescription information and displays it for verification. Once confirmed, patients can proceed to payment via QR code.
<li><strong>OTC Drug Dispensing:</strong> Zooba offers a selection of OTC drugs for patients without a prescription. Patients can choose the desired medication and complete the purchase through QR code payment.
<li><strong>Chatbot Healthcare Assistant:</strong> Zooba's integrated chatbot provides initial healthcare guidance. Patients can describe their symptoms, and the chatbot will recommend appropriate OTC medications or advise seeking professional medical attention if necessary.
